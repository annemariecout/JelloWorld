Description: Jello World is all about customizing your own small jello town on planet Jellatin.
As Jolleen, the third person character, you can wander around this unknown land, collect mysterious ingredients, and come back to your kitchen to prepare jello mixes. Carefully plant the magic jello seeds that are given to you, and wait for the result!

I made this game during my last term in the Game Development program at Vertex School.
I used blueprints for most of the game mechanics, and C++ code for the exploding bubbles, floating actors (limes and jello pieces) and the projectiles (see repository UnrealEngine_CPP).

Hope you make jello town your own little jello fantasy!
